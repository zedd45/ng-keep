Angular U 2015 ES6 Workshop
===========================

# What is this?

This workshop was led & taught by [@hendrixer](https://github.com/hendrixer).  This workshop is intended to convey concepts for how to use Angular with ES6 / ES2015 today. 

We are building a prototype of [Google Keep](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep&hl=en) in `Angular 1.4`, using [`Babel`](https://babeljs.io/) to transpile our ES6 to ES5, and [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) to compile our assets. 

# Installation 

Install [Node JS](http://nodejs.org/), which currently includes `npm`.

```
npm i && npm run serve
```
